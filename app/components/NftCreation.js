      <LinkText para_text_a="Lazy Minting is an advanced method of minting NFTs for artists and creators by not having to pay upfront, as it is called, gas fees. This process entails the off-chain creation of NFTs, followed by minting them only when a sale is completed. This implies that artists do not need to make payments for upfront gas fees required for minting NFTs thus, the process gets cheaper. Lazy Minting can be utilized as a means of delaying minting until just before the sale of the NFT. In this manner, sellers pay the minting fee only after their NFT is sold, enabling the creators to develop it at no cost. One of the simplest ways to produce NFTs is through lazy mintings. Unlike traditional minting, you don’t have to undergo a tedious and lengthy process. Lazy Minting allows quick listing of digital art on marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible.
